This a demo [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app coded in
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) for showing earthquakes on a map.

The project is a part of the
[geospatial_demos](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial_demos) that
is a companion demo code repository for the 
[Geospatial tools for Dart](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial).

## :sparkles: Introduction

<img src="assets/screenshots/map_view.jpg" align="right" width="40%" title="Earthquake Map - Map View" />

Shows earthquakes fetched from the [USGS web service](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/) on a basic map view.

Coding topics:
* **State management** (settings, query filters, Web API data access, presentation formatters, map view markers).
* Using a **Web API client to access geospatial data** formatted as [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) feature and geometry objects.
* Visualizing earthquakes (that are geospatial feature entities with point geometries) as **map markers on a map view**.

Notes:
* The UI of this sample app is very basic. The app focuses on a clean demonstration of the topics mentioned above.
* To run this demo, you need to obtain and configure an API key for Google Maps.
* Supported platforms: only iOS and Android

Dart packages utilized:
* [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable): equality and hash utils
* [geobase](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase): geospatial data structures and vector data support for GeoJSON
* [geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata): fetching a Web API with GeoJSON data
* [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl): localized date formatting
* [state_notifier](https://pub.dev/packages/state_notifier): helps manipulating a state object with multiple ways to update it 

Flutter packages utilized:
* [flutter_riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod): an efficient and straightforward state management library (see also [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) docs)
* [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter): a map view widget for iOS and Android platforms (Note: an API key must be configured)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

The demo app requires at least [Dart](https://dart.dev/) SDK 2.17 and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) SDK 3.0.

Check instructions to setup [Google Maps for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter). At least you must change API keys on:

- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
    - manifest -> application
        - `<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="<YOUR-APIKEY>"/>`
- ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
    - AppDelegate -> application
        - `GMSServices.provideAPIKey("<YOUR-APIKEY>")`
